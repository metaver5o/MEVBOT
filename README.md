# MEVBOT
Frontrunning, Transaction Reordering, and Consensus Instability in Decentralized Exchanges

* Slippage Protection: Implement slippage protection to mitigate the impact of MEV sandwich attacks by checking the price impact between the desired trade and the actual executed trade. You can use an external price oracle or on-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) to retrieve the expected trade price and compare it with the actual execution price.

```
function executeTrade(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint256 amountIn, uint256 minAmountOut) external {
    // Get the expected output amount from a reliable price oracle or DEX
    uint256 expectedAmountOut = getPriceFromOracle(tokenIn, tokenOut, amountIn);
  
    // Ensure the price impact is within an acceptable range
    require(expectedAmountOut >= minAmountOut, "Slippage protection: Price impact too high");

    // Execute the trade
    // ...
}
```

* Time Delay Protection: Implement a time delay between trade execution and settlement to allow for cancellation or detection of potential sandwich attacks. This can give users an opportunity to react and protect themselves.

```
mapping(address => uint256) public lastTradeTimestamp;

function executeTrade(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint256 amountIn, uint256 minAmountOut) external {
    // Check the time delay since the last trade
    require(block.timestamp >= lastTradeTimestamp[msg.sender] + 60, "Time delay protection: Too soon to execute trade");

    // Update the last trade timestamp
    lastTradeTimestamp[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;

    // Execute the trade
    // ...
}
```

* Whitelist Protection: Implement a whitelist of trusted addresses that can execute trades without restrictions. This allows trusted parties to bypass the protection mechanisms while applying them to untrusted parties.

```
mapping(address => bool) public whitelistedAddresses;

function executeTrade(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint256 amountIn, uint256 minAmountOut) external {
    // Check if the address is whitelisted
    require(whitelistedAddresses[msg.sender], "Whitelist protection: Address not authorized");

    // Execute the trade
    // ...
}

```
